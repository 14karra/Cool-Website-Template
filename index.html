			<p class="HomePresentationText">Google is an American multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products that include online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, software, and hardware.</p>

			<p class="HomePresentationText">Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, California. Together, they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and we moved to our new headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.</p>

			<p class="HomePresentationText">In August 2015, we announced plans to reorganize our interests as a holding company called Alphabet Inc. When this restructuring took place on October 2, 2015, Google became Alphabet's leading subsidiary, as well as the parent for Google's Internet interests.</p>

			<p class="HomePresentationText">we have been estimated to run more than one million servers in data centers around the world (as of 2007). we processes over one billion search requests and about 24 petabytes of user-generated data each day (as of 2009). In December 2013, Alexa listed Google.com as the most visited website in the world. Numerous Google sites in other languages figure in the top one hundred, as do several other Google-owned sites such as YouTube and Blogger.</p>

			<p class="HomePresentationText">We have been the second most valuable brand in the world for 4 consecutive years, and have a valuation in 2016 at $133 billion. Google's mission statement from the outset was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful," and our unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil". In October 2015, the motto was replaced in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: "Do the right thing".</p>
